## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run the Tune music application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository  
   git clone https://github.com/burakzor/Tune.git  
   cd Tune

2. Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse  
   - Launch your Java IDE.  
   - Select File > Open and navigate to the Tune directory.  
   - Let the IDE index and build the project.

3. Setup MongoDB Database  
   - This project uses a remote MongoDB database hosted online.  
   - Ensure you have access credentials and the connection string from your database provider.

4. Configure the Database Connection  
   - Update the MongoDB connection string in the code to use your remote database URL and credentials, for example:  
     `MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(new MongoClientURI("your-remote-mongodb-connection-string"));`

5. Run the Application  
   - just run Start.java

The application should launch with its full graphical interface and functionality, connected to the remote database.
